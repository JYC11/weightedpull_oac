- 33:50 ~ 50:30 is where my analysis is in
- Seeing the entire thing would help with context tbh

2021 June => Had no idea what I was doing and did this project on my old Linux which soon died after. Absolutely terrible file organization and chaotic data cleaning.

2022-02-17 => reorganized files and probably file inputs and outputs are probably wrong after foldering. I think I'll do data and code organisation as this for now and use this as a learning experience for my future data projects if there are any. I learnt a lot about programming best practices after switching over to just straight up programming so I think I can do better next time.

## Project Explanation

The question my coach(along with many other calisthenics atheletes) had was:

- Will adding enough weight to your pull ups leads to one arm chin up?

My coach is also a youtuber and when he mentioned this to me I offered to help do the survey and the data analysis.

I helped with the survey design and performed data analysis.
